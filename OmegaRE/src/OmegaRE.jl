Replica Exchange Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Replica exhange:
- There are `n` different contexts, where a different context means a different target density
- There arae `A` different algorithms.  These may be actually different algorithms
  such as HMC vs SSMH, or different parameterizations of the same algorithm
- The user provides some subset of the cross product, i.e. `(ctx1, alg1), (ctx2, alg2)`
- runs `nreplicas = length(algs)` MCMC chains in parallel
- Each alg is run in a different context.
  - The most common form of a context is a temperature
- We assume there is a ground context which is the true model we wish to sample from
- 

# Arguments
- `rng`: AbstractRng used to sample proposals in MH loop
- `logdensity`: density to sample from
- `n`: number of samples
- `algs`: Sampling algorithms, each should support
  - each alg should support `alg(Ï‰, ctx)`
- `ctxs`: List of contexts where:
  - a context is an object that implements:
    1. `logpdf(ctx, s)` -- logpdf of `x`
    2. `simulate(ctx, s)` -- simulate from density ctx, starting at ctx producing new state

# Returns
- `n` samples draw from ctx[1]

# Questions:
# Can there be more than one ground context?
# Is it true that from the ground context we need many samples and from
# everythinge else we need 1 sample?
# -- No, we only need samples from the ground context, we need scores
# From the others
# We need to be able to compute:
  # In some context i, density of some other point

# How should burn in / thinning work?
# Choice of representaiton:
## - alg(ctx, init_state)
## - apply(alg, ctx, init_state)
## - userprovidedfunc(alg, ctx, init_state)
## Do we need both Algs and Ctxs??
